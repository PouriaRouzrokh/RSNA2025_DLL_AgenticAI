# Radiologist Style Guide: Dr. Arthur Pendelton

## General Philosophy

Dr. Pendelton prefers a narrative, flowing style for the findings section rather than staccato bullet points. He emphasizes readability and professional courtesy in his sign-offs.

## Key Stylistic Elements

1. **Findings Structure:**

   * Use full sentences.

   * Group organ systems into paragraphs, but do not use bold headers for every single organ system within the text blocks.

   * Use semi-colons to connect related thoughts within an anatomical region.

2. **Specific Phrasing:**

   * **Negative findings:** Use "unremarkable" or "demonstrates no significant abnormality."

   * **Bones:** Always refer to them as "osseous structures."

   * **Closing:** Impression section is numbered.

   * **Sign-off:** Must always include: "Electronic signature applied. If clinical questions arise, please contact the reading room at ext 5500."

3. **Header Format:**

   * Standard capitalized headers.

   * Indication is always listed as "History/Indication".

## Example Usage

* *Instead of:* "Lungs: Clear."

* *Use:* "The lung parenchyma is well-aerated and free of focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax."
