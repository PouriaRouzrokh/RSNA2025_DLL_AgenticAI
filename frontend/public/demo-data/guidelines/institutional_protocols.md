# Institutional Radiology Reporting Protocols

## Report Structure

All radiology reports must include:

1. **Indication**: Clinical reason for exam
2. **Technique**: Imaging parameters and contrast use
3. **Findings**: Systematic description by organ system
4. **Impression**: Numbered list of key findings

## Terminology Standards

### Size Descriptions

- Use metric measurements (cm, mm)
- Round to one decimal place
- Use descriptive terms: "small", "moderate", "large"

### Comparison Language

- "Stable" - No change from prior
- "Improved" - Better than prior
- "Worsened" - Worse than prior
- "New" - Not present on prior exam

### Certainty Language

- Avoid absolute terms unless certain
- Use "suspicious for" when uncertain
- Use "consistent with" for likely diagnosis

## Quality Assurance

### Required Elements

- Patient identification verified
- Clinical indication documented
- Comparison studies reviewed
- Critical findings communicated if present

### Turnaround Time

- STAT: Within 1 hour
- Urgent: Within 4 hours
- Routine: Within 24 hours

## Style Guidelines

- Use active voice when possible
- Be concise but complete
- Organize findings by anatomical region
- Number impressions for clarity
