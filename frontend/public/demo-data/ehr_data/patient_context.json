      "note": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nMr. Vancamp is a 66-year-old male with a history of HTN, GERD, and mild tobacco use who presents today with a complaint of a persistent dry cough for approximately 3 weeks. He states the cough began gradually. It is non-productive, tickly, and worse when lying down at night. He denies fevers, chills, night sweats, or hemoptysis. He reports no shortness of breath with exertion, though the coughing fits can be tiring. He has tried over-the-counter cough syrups with minimal relief. He denies recent travel or sick contacts.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\nConstitutional: Negative for fever, significant weight loss, or fatigue.\nRespiratory: Positive for dry cough. Negative for wheezing, hemoptysis, or pleuritic pain.\nCardiovascular: Negative for chest pain, palpitations, or edema.\nGI: Reports occasional heartburn, controlled with Omeprazole. No dysphagia.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVitals: BP 130/82, HR 76, RR 16, Temp 98.6 F, SpO2 98% on RA. Weight: 185 lbs (stable).\nGen: Alert, no acute distress, speaking in full sentences.\nHEENT: Oropharynx clear, no erythema or exudates. Neck supple, no lymphadenopathy.\nCV: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.\nLungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi detected. Good air entry.\nExtremities: No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.\n\nASSESSMENT & PLAN:\n1. Persistent Cough (R05.9): Etiology unclear. Differential includes post-nasal drip, GERD-related cough, or ACE-inhibitor induced cough (though he has been on Lisinopril for years without issue). Given his age and smoking history (approx 15 pack-years, current 5 cigs/day), we must rule out pulmonary pathology.\n   - Plan: Order CT Chest without contrast.\n   - Discussed smoking cessation; patient advised to cut down."
